'''You have:

python = 10
java = python
python = 20


Print java. Explain why the value is that.
'''
python=10 # I assign python =10 
java=python#java=python means python have 10 so java=python means java=10(python value)
python=20#now i am change python value to 20
print(java)
print(python)
#Note i change Python as 20 at last but it didnt affect java because at first i assign python =10then i said java=python so first line assign the value 10 to python second value python assigned to java so third i change python value it didnt get change
